Arkworks made simple

## Arkworks documentation and examples

There are five examples, some of them taken directly from `Arkworks`, that serve as an introduction to arkworks. You can run them by doing:

``` shell
cargo test --release --example test-circuit
cargo test --release --example manual-constraints
cargo test --release --example merkle-tree
cargo test --release --example schnorr-signature
cargo test --release --example simple-payments
```

You can check out the code for them under the `examples` directory.
